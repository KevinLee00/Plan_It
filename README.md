# Plan_It

The purpose of this Android mobile application is to generate a plan for your day. If you're
feeling adventurous, "Plan It" will randomly generate a full-day schedule for you
based on events and establishments around your location. If you're feeling indecisive,
"Plan It" will give you suggested events and restaurants for you and your friends to
go to so you don't need to fight over where to go/eat. The app will also reward
users with tokens and badges for accomplishing certain tasks. For example, if you
successfully checkin to 10 of the suggested events, you can earn a "adventurous
badge."

Basically, sit back and let Plan It decide what to do on your free day!
