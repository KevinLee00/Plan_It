# Plan It

The purpose of this Android mobile application is to generate a plan for your day. If you're
feeling adventurous or if you just can't decided what to do, "Plan It" will randomly generate a full-day schedule for you
based on events and businesses around your location. If you're feeling indecisive,
"Plan It" will suggest restaurants and places to go for you and your friends so you don't need to fight over where to go/eat. 

Sit back and let Plan It decide what to do on your free day and earn badges along the way!

## Instructions on how to run the app
1. Pull the code from the github and build the project by going to Build > Clean Project
2. Next run the app by either clicking the the green play button or by going to Run > Run 'app"
3. There will be a pop up asking whether you want to run the app on a physical phone or using the built in emulator. Follow these instructions [here](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app.html) to get it set up. Once you've chosen your choice click 'ok'
4. *NOTE:* This will **not work** with the Android Studio emulator because the emulator has no access to a GPS. This must be run on an Android device.

### Future Features:
The app will also reward users with tokens and badges for accomplishing certain tasks. For example, if you
successfully checkin to 10 of the suggested events, you can earn a "adventurous
badge."
